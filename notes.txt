Design a Twitter-like social network website for making posts and following users.

Likely have to augment User model
Need additional models to represent details about
    posts,
    likes,
    & followers

Using
    Python,
    JavaScript,
    HTML,
    & CSS,
        complete the implementation of a social network

The network must allow users to
    make posts,
    follow other users,
    & 'like' posts

NEW POST
    Signed in users should be able to write a new text-based post using a form with
        a text area,
        & a submit button
    Form should be placed at the beginning of ALL POSTS page

ALL POSTS
    Show all posts from all users
    Most recent posts on top
    Each post must include
        poster's username (must be a link to their profile),
        post's content,
        posting date and time,
        & post's number of likes (initially 0)

PROFILE PAGE
    Clicking on a username should load user's profile page which should:
        Display
            the number of followers the user has,
            the number of people the user follows,
            all the posts made by the user (rev-chrono)
        For any **other** signed in user, show
            a follow/unfollow toggle button

FOLLOWING
    The 'Following' link from navbar should take to a page with all the posts made by the current user follows.
    Only available to signed in users
    (Behaves essentially the same as All Posts link)

PAGINATION
    Show 10 posts per page
    If more than 10 posts, show Next button
    If not on first page, also show Previous button
    Check HINTS

EDIT POST
    Users should be able to click an Edit button/link on their own posts
    Replace content area with textarea filled with content
    Show save button which onclick should work without reloading the entire page !!JavaScript!!
    Make sure no one but OP can edit posts

LIKE/UNLIKE
    Signed in users should be able to click a button/link toggle to like/unlike a post
    Update a post's like count using JS fetch calls
